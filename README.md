### **Railway Inspection Robot Algorithm Description**

This algorithm outlines the functioning of a **railway inspection robot** designed to automate train undercarriage inspections. It ensures seamless operation through modular processes, fault detection, and real-time communication.

---

### **1. Initialize the Robot**  
- **`initialize_robot()`**:  
   - Prepares the robot for operation by setting up critical components:  
     - **Pneumatic Legs**: These are deployed to stabilize the robot on the track.  
     - **Wheels**: Ensures mobility for track navigation.  
     - **Web App Connectivity**: Establishes communication with the monitoring system for real-time data exchange.

---

### **2. Start Robot Movement**  
- **`start_movement()`**:  
   - Deploys pneumatic legs onto the track.  
   - Activates powered wheels to begin movement.  
   - The robot autonomously follows the track using navigation systems.

---

### **3. Perform Inspections**  
- **`perform_inspections()`**:  
   - This function carries out **various fault inspections** using image processing, sensors, and AI models.  
   - **Sub-tasks Include**:  
     1. **Surface Cracks Detection**: Captures images and identifies cracks using detection models.  
        - **Alert**: Notifies of surface cracks.  
     2. **Discoloration Detection**: Detects unusual discoloration in critical components.  
     3. **Suspension Damage Detection**: Analyzes images to identify suspension-related faults.  
     4. **Gas Leakage Detection**: Detects leaks using gas sensors.  
     5. **Wheel Wear Detection**: Identifies wheel surface wear through image analysis.  
     6. **Overheating Detection**: Monitors temperature anomalies using thermal sensors.  
   - Alerts for detected issues are sent to the web app for immediate reporting.

---

### **4. Communication with the Web App**  
- **`connect_to_web_app()`**:  
   - Establishes two-way communication for real-time updates.  
   - While the robot is active, it performs the following:  
     - **Sends Status Updates**: Reports inspection progress and fault alerts.  
     - **Receives Commands**: Allows manual control or adjustments from the web app.

---

### **5. Handle Received Commands**  
- **`handle_commands(command)`**:  
   - Processes commands received from the web app:  
     - **STOP**: Halts all robot operations.  
     - **PAUSE**: Temporarily stops movement while maintaining current status.  
     - **RESUME**: Restarts movement and inspections.

---

### **6. Stop the Robot**  
- **`stop_robot()`**:  
   - Safely halts the robot’s movement.  
   - Retracts the pneumatic legs for easy removal from the track.  
   - Disconnects from the web app, finalizing the operation.

---

### **Main Execution Flow**  
- **`main()`**:  
   - Manages the overall workflow:  
     1. Initializes the robot.  
     2. Starts movement and navigates the track.  
     3. Continuously performs inspections while monitoring the track status.  
     4. Sends real-time updates to the web app.  
     5. Stops operations upon reaching the end of the track.

---

### **Key Features**  
- **Autonomous Inspection**: Automates fault detection (cracks, discoloration, gas leaks, overheating).  
- **Real-Time Communication**: Sends live updates and receives commands from the monitoring system.

# 🔩 Missing Bolt Detection using YOLOv8

This project detects missing bolts in mechanical assemblies using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The model is trained on a custom dataset prepared via [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) and fine-tuned using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework.

🚧 **Purpose**: Automate visual inspection to ensure fast, accurate detection of missing bolts in real-time applications.
